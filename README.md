LPG_Booking_System with Python with Linked MySQL Database


‘LPG Booking System’ is a GUI based System for the agency to minimize their work and let the System handle the records. It also makes it easier for the agency to check the number as a person has booked in a specific amount of time and the person who is booking the gas is authenticated or not whether he/she has bought the refill within the time period, to get his gas booked.

The Project uses the following Libraries:- 
1) Ttk from tkinter
2) Image,ImageTk from PIL 
3) Mysql.connector 
4) Messagebox from tkinter

Note:- The project works on Connected SQL Database System. All the steps written in the howtoconfigure text file should be followed to run the main file smoothly.
